# yolo-training-pipeline Specification

## Purpose

One local CPU Docker command generates a deterministic detection fixture, validates YOLO annotations, trains YOLO26 from architecture without downloading weights, evaluates held-out mAP, emits a verifiable model bundle, reloads the best checkpoint, and measures warmed inference latency.

## Requirements

### Requirement: reproducible portfolio proof

The system SHALL expose a local-first path that proves the primary benchmark
declared in `project.yaml` without paid credentials.

#### Scenario: default verification

- GIVEN the repository is checked out with its committed fixtures
- WHEN the documented Docker or local benchmark command runs
- THEN a JSON result is written under `benchmarks/results/`
- AND the README reports the same measured number

### Requirement: replaceable integrations

The system SHALL keep external providers behind ports or adapters whenever a
provider is not part of the core claim.

#### Scenario: adapter substitution

- GIVEN a local adapter and a future real-provider adapter implement the same port
- WHEN either adapter is selected by configuration
- THEN the application use cases keep the same observable contract
